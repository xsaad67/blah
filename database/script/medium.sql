It is an entrepreneur&rsquo;s ability to analyse the risks before it arrives. The Hofstede&rsquo;s culture dimension identifies that which country of the world takes initiative towards risks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The successful economies such as Russia, South Korea, Turkey, Belgium, Australia, Norway, etc. are the large economies who work towards uncertainty avoidance. The corporate world of these cultures is also inconsistent with the risk avoidance practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Rule no. 7: Stealing ideas</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Every business is not innovative at all. There are businesses in the industry that are just followers and preparing tremendous goods and services by copying market leaders. As Samsung is in competition with iPhone, it copies every model of the iPhone and thus, it is market leader today. The successful businesses also compete on behalf of the compatibility of the price of the product or service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, your business ideas may also get steal. In this situation, you have to just focus on the innovation and induce series of innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Rule no. 8: Establish a relationship with customers</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is very important for the businesses to establish rapport with customers. It is not enough that you have got regular customers for your business; you have to further make strategies to not let it go towards your competitors. For example take an example of KFC, McDonald&rsquo;s and Domino&rsquo;s Pizza. Customers love ambiance of these food chains and love quality of the food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every business has to retain its customers. Large organizations also give discount packages to their customers on different occasions and make them feel that they are valued customers. Don&rsquo;t just keep saying you are our valued customers, instead show that they are.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Rule no. 9: Time estimation can be extended</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>For a business, it is necessary that budgeting and time allocation can be long. For example, if a business is giving more time to gain customers and getting slow response it does not mean they have not succeeded. If people see promotions then they come soon to the product or service they sell. However, it takes some time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Rule no. 10: Use marketing tools strategically</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As people don&rsquo;t want to read much, successful businesses show them images. There brochures, company websites and Facebook page does not include massive information. They have to give explanation of the goods or services through images. This takes less time to grab the customers&rsquo; attention.</p>', 1, 3, 'published', '10-important-rules-to-succeed-in-business', 1, 1, 1, '2018-09-28 14:54:28', '2018-09-28 14:54:28', NULL),

The International Labour Organisation (ILO) shows that there is about 71 million unemployed fall in the age range of 15- 21 across the global region and confronting with unemployment in the long run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to OECD, the rates of unemployment in term of education level across the different region of the globe are shown in the following the chart.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://medium.localhost/wysiwyg/3568graph.png\" style=\"height:365px; width:650px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ironically, South Africa is recognised as one of the highest budgets spends on overall world education system and focused on enhancing the basic education quality. The economy, unemployment and education are intertwined in South Africa. In South Africa, the educational crises can be blamed for the cause of unemployment due to the presence of various flaws for instance absence of radical pedagogy and basic proficiencies required for imparting the learner skills, inadequate resources and a persistent shift in the syllabus of the curriculum. The young people without income and experience are highly vulnerable to continued lifetime poverty and dreadfully looking to avail more promising future. Hence they move to other states to avail the opportunities of improved and better life. The unemployment for chronic youth place a brake on local economies and absence of skilled and literate workforce restricted the abilities of business for generation of improved profitability and better employment opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;The mainstream of worldwide employers finds it highly challenging to procure the individual with the required skills. Particularly in developing states, it is challenging to narrow down the gaps of skills, and such crises lurk behind the unemployment of youth. The primary challenge faced by global education is relied on the absence of investment, based on the concept realised by a community of business in an effective manner. The contemporary economist emphasised a new issue of mismatch of skills possess by young people and one required by employees. Employers are inundated with incumbent applications&mdash;nevertheless, they protest that they are failed to find candidates with an accurate set of capabilities and skills. According to McKinsey Consultancy Report, about 44% employers in 9 states are able to find adequate entry-level skilled workers. The nine countries are India, Britain, Germany, Brazil, America, Morocco, Turkey, Mexico and Saudi Arabia. The most evident reason for skill mismatch is based on the poor and deprived level of fundamental education system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;In well-developed and advanced economies the rate of jobless for the individual is lower as compared to the secondary educational level at a school that is twofold time greater in contrast with university degrees. The states with a lowermost rate of jobless of youth have a close association with work and education. The prolonged tradition of Germany is based on apprenticeships and eminent vocational education to decreases the unemployment of youth in spite of modest growth. The states with great unemployment of youth are deficient in these aspects. In French society, few leavers of school merely have any real work experience.&nbsp; The universities located in North Africa are emphasised on the preparation of students for filling the jobs of civil service where organisation are complaining regarding the technical skills shortage. The rate of unemployment in Morocco is about five times greater for graduates in contrast with an individual having merely a primary education. The organisations are intended to fulfil this gap by investment in training. According to the consultancy report of Accenture, about 21% of one thousand US workers have acquired novel skills from the training provided by the company in the past five years. In the year 2017, the rate of employment is more significant for adults having a greater educational level in contrast with people having a lower educational level.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://medium.localhost/wysiwyg/4614graph2.png\" style=\"height:342px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In overseas states, the graduate students are highly keen on taking the unpaid internship at the well-reputed company with the expectation to attain more information for the development of experience. They place their pride prior to an essential aspect of the job market that is based on knowledge, experience and skills. It is argued that alone education cannot fix the issue of unemployment. Some people claimed that there are varied issues pertinent to unemployment of graduate students that mainly consists of demand of employer for experience at work, policies of taxation, the absence of incentives of employers and deprived economic performance. However, education may not be blamed for the failure for the fixation of unemployment of graduate, in spite of barrier for resolution of challenges required to be addressed and concerned parties required acknowledging their responsibilities for resolution of the problem.

The proficiencies and skills required in the labour market have gone beyond the formal level of education. The overall systems of education are required to support the development of employment skills, learning of career management, innovation and entrepreneurship. The skill sets cannot be taught employing a formal system of education and required to be identified by an institution of higher education and alike employers.

Around 37% of Americans were in favor of football, as likely to play, participate, watch, and win. The sport has gained considerable attention as much as 43 per cent from 2006 and 2007, in the US. However, if the ratio of likeness to football compared with the baseball, it&rsquo;s just only 9% people who would like to play baseball. Thus, from 1937 to 2017, there seems an increasing number of US people, like football as a sport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several reasons that football becomes the world&rsquo;s most favorite sport. For example, it seems to adjust and fit into the psyche of people. It has its origin and roots across so many different parts of the world. Rather than this, the other sports might be associated with some specific country or region, like cricket or rugby seems popular across the Commonwealth countries or Baseball in North America. The shapes or forms of football although different in the past, at the time of its origination, in China or Japan, and then gradually move with some change in Argentina and England. Hence, football does not only play across the richest and well-developed countries of the world but among poorer or developing countries as well, like across Asian, African and Latin American countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is another reason behind such a strong preference for football, as the sport has its pre-defined rules and an organized format. It&rsquo;s a user-friendly format and rules, as easy to understand by the different ages of people. Also, football as a sport has significantly grown in terms of technology, thus familiar among luxury or &ldquo;high-touch&rdquo; people. Consequently, understanding with the sports rule could easily develop by all people, live across any geographic region. Football is also preferred due to its short duration as the match last up to 90 minutes. The time duration is much as half compared to the other sports, like baseball. Also, the number of days seems less, than as compared to a five days cricket tournament. Thus, as much as the short time of a sport, it maintains and retains the zest and enthusiasm of the audience towards the sport, and provides convenience to several busy audience groups or people. Similarly, short duration events easy to arrange, help in football events expansion, worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The format of football is easy to understand, and it is not specific to a country, language, region, or religion. For example, the form of cricket and rugby seems not easy to understand by people, all around the world. The format of football will remain similar in America, Africa, or any other region. It takes several days, to cover up a cricket event, like one-day and Twenty20 matches. It is, therefore, due to the easiness of the sport, football is considered the most common, understandable and popular game, all around the world, thus recognized its value. Moreover, it is important to notice that football does not involve too much cost, in terms of purchasing the related equipment. For example, cricket includes ball, bat, fielding and the other necessary accessories to wear, before starting the game. However, football does only involve a shot that needs to throw out through the legs. It does just need the most required accessory, like wearing suitable costumes, etc. Thus, there seem fewer expenses incurred, at the time of arranging as well as playing football. For example, tennis also appears to take a cost, to purchase the net, board, ball, etc., thus play up well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is another reason behind the high preference of football, i.e. it could clearly understand the time of start and finish or end time of the sport. For example, the other sports events, like athletics, cycling or swimming, the audience usually could not understand the start and end time of the sport, and the leisure activity. There is not such a strong league, applied or arrange for the other small sports events. However, football has a definite competitive structure, arrange among a group of players, and help support each other, as well as learn through each other too. Overall, such dominance of football, all around the world, reinforces all local and international heroes to unite at one single platform. It does also unite all such different brands at one place, in the course of sponsorship and promotion of the event. The main objective is to refresh people&rsquo;s mind and heart through an enthusiastic sports activity, while promoting products and services, in a positive sense. It is, therefore, football becomes able to cheer up the mind of people, and make up the biggest global fan base all around the world.

Most of the essays include persuasiveness in them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main theme of persuasive writing basically is evaluation, argument and discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For supporting the persuasive facts and ideas you have to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Research other&rsquo;s point of views (particularly scholarly articles and books)</li>\r\n	<li>Look for patterns in data or references to identify strongest evidence</li>\r\n	<li>Identify real-life implications that is beneficial</li>\r\n	<li>Discuss facts and ideas with someone else</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Persuasive kind of papers is also known as<em> argumentative</em> paper, in order to develop argument one has to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Search reasons of what you are writing</li>\r\n	<li>Think and identify different kind of sources as evidence of your point of view</li>\r\n	<li>Develop reasons for what previously written by researchers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Breaking down information and highlight each part such as environmental, cost effectiveness, scope of real-world application and sustainability</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><em>Critical</em></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Critical writing is common among postgraduate, research and advanced undergraduate writing. It involves features of persuasive writing. However, persuasively written papers include at least one point of view and critical analysis involves two viewpoints that is backed by your own opinion at the last.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An example of this kind of critical academic writing involves a critique from a journal article or literature reviews to identify the strengths and weaknesses of existing research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are further divisions of critical writing that involves debate, critique, evaluate and disagree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For establishing a critical academic paper one has to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Provide accurate summary of the discussion</li>\r\n	<li>Your own appropriate opinion for the discussion</li>\r\n	<li>Give evidence of each point of view you incorporated in the paper</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Purpose of academic writing is to develop understanding of the reader. It should be thus, concise and clear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the college-level research papers involve following elements to be followed:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong><em>Planned and focused</em></strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The structure of overall assignment should be well prepared, formal and logical. Students may not start with the manipulation of structure from the beginning. But as they go through different sections and questions of their assignments they start preparing a flow of structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Language</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Development of researcher paper involves unambiguity in the assignments. We have to research many things and put all information at one place. For this purpose language may dwindle at several places. In this situation, paragraphs and sentences should be inter-linked with each other. Moreover, vague expressions are avoided in academic writing such as <em>they, people, the organization</em> etc. The assignment should be specific and avoid use of the words such as <em>very, incredible, super</em> etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The important element in academic writing is writing using passive voice. For instance in the following sentence:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tesco use cost-differentiation strategy to remain competent in the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tesco and cost-differentiation strategy are important. Hence, you may write it as:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cost-differentiation strategy is focused by Tesco to achieve competency in the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This practice would enhance different features of writing assignments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Punctuation</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The academic writing involves concrete, precise and summative narrative tone. Therefore, punctuation marks are required to place at different positions in the paper to make it a formal paper. However, punctuation marks are avoided in the academic writing because it shows over excitement and remains unsophisticated. Dashes and hyphens are minimized in the case of academic writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They give an impression of informal writing that is why they are used seldom in the papers. For instance hyphens may use to connect the prefixes like over-burden, multi-dimensional etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Evidence-Based arguments</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The evidence based arguments give weightage to the authenticity of information provided in your assignment. It is necessary to develop an argument and precisely discuss it. However, there is the need of certain evidence form scholarly articles and books to confirm that these arguments exist in the world previously. This practice is necessary for the document where there is need of proposing solutions for the identified problem (s).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Complexity and Higher-Order Thinking</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The academic writing involves conciseness and concreteness in it. This is the reason that it requires complexity of the discussion and information provided in the document. Moreover, there should be logical thinking behind information that has received and articulated in the paper. The theme of your paper should be reflective, critical, creative as well as logical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is also noticeable that paper is relevant to the topic and comprehends knowledge maintaining its relevancy. The ideas should represent in the comprehensive manner advocating explanation about the opinion you have articulated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This understanding of kind of academic writing and tips articulated will help students to develop clear explanation towards reader that what you want to state. Precisely, it will portray your opinion.</p>', 1, 7, 'published', 'how-to-create-an-academic-paper', 1, 1, 3, '2018-10-01 15:53:53', '2018-10-01 16:02:17', NULL),

An essay involves three major parts that are <strong><em>introduction, body and conclusion</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An outline should involve all the headings and subheadings that you are going to incorporate in your essay. For example if you are going to prepare an essay on advantages and disadvantages of social media then it would not only articulate advantages and disadvantages of the social media. You would have to give introduction of your document before starting advantages and disadvantages of it. Then you would have to state its history and then you come towards advantages and disadvantages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An example of outlining essay is:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.Introduction</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.1 History of Social media</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.Evolution of internet</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.1 Development of social networks</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Advantages of social media</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.1 Education Field</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2 Business field</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.3 Consumers</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Disadvantages of social media</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.1 Crime</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.2 Online sexual exploitation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.3 Cyber bullying</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.4 Addiction to social media</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.Conclusion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.Recommendation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is the appropriate outline of an essay.

It resulted in the improved awareness of culture as well as tolerance. The abroad education is helpful for the development of in-depth realization of the world and has the vital contribution in marketability of career specifically personal growth. The contemporary organizations are seeking for human resources having excellent skills of communication as well as cross culture capabilities that can be foster by overseas education. The studying in the foreign country is the highly expensive process. There is some manner for helping the international education for the purpose of funding. The three most prevailing potential sources for abroad funding are Scholarships, Financial Aid as well as Loans.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Scholarship:</strong> A scholarship is considered as the excellent sources that neglected by the majority of students due to a complicated procedure. A student can be highly overwhelmed at the time of application and absolute time is required for scouring the scholarship. A standardized search on the web would lead to ample outcomes and communication with overseas education advisor is considered as the critical element. The conversation with an advisor assures enabling the required information from an authentic and reliable source. The international education advisor can refer the small scholarship not offering adequate money, however, are not as much as competitive, and also elevated the shot to earn the additional stream of money. In a few instances, Universities offered the scholarship to those students that are capable of writing a substantial essay on the subject of how abroad studying is significant and what is anticipated to attain from the abroad semester.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Financial Aid:</strong> A careful and vigilant approach must be taken to avail financial aid. As all universities might have different policies. The abroad semester has become highly famous among students, and there are so many schools that are offering the financial aid package for overseas education. It indicates that the deal considered for financial aid office is remaining pertinent for obtaining the experience of abroad study. If your school or colleges don&rsquo;t have the adequate policy, then the best approach is based on the adoption of a proactive approach from a financial aid office. Inquire them about anything for application in specific available aid packages. It may or may not end up luckily.&nbsp; The sole manner to ensure about this fact is to ask with financial power for earning the additional source of money.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Loans:</strong> The loans are considered as the most viable option. Nevertheless, the consideration of a loan requires a cautious approach. Recall that there is disparity among loan, scholarship and financial aid that students have to pay back for each dollar for students after the graduation of students. Certainly, it must be the double check to determine if there is any Perkin or Stafford alternative; however, it is highly lean. By relying on the credit or else co-signer credit, a student can look for the private loan from banks. However, the loan from bank evolved with the unfortunate slap of greater rate of interest; however, a majority of students can be turned into private sources of a loan when money is required and recognized that fact that it evolved with the additional cost. Extensive research is required for the selection of right bank that can be shaved off with the greater rate of interest. However, a rationale warning is that rates are identical across different institutions due to existing economy state and federal reserves to establish the standards of borrowing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Students should not be afraid of seeking multiple sources of funds such as the combination of loan and scholarship. It is considered as the financial idea, and well-advised opine and adoption of a proactive planning approach will make the overall process simple and easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to consider the traditional and conventional options for saving. As student decided for overseas studying, the student can work to save for the trips. It is advised to adopt a realistic approach as saving merely is not adequate for sufficient funding. Nonetheless, saving is considered as the most obvious manner for affording the abroad education. Every little bit saving is helpful for spending less on unessential binges. Prior to making a huge buying; ask them, if a purchase is more important than overseas education. If you sacrifice the purchase for the sake of studying abroad, each penny or dollar saving reduces the proximity for fulfilling the financial requirement of study abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another alternative to arranging the financial funds is to seek relative help. The overseas education is the highly expensive process; however, it is considered as the future investment. The parent and near relative can be willing to help and arrange the financial funds. The student can also establish a fund for travelling to save the money for studying abroad. One can write blogs to seek financial help and added the donation button on some Master Cards, to make it simple for any individual to gain some money to avail financial assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The students can also apply for the aid through the school or give an application for federal aid from the reference of school or college. Moreover, many international educational institutes are offering financial aid to a few overseas students on the basis of merit, in spite of financial backgrounds. The type of aid varied from different universities and educational study level. More assistance is offered for graduate education and rather fewer for undergraduate educational programs. The financial funds are perceptively available in different fields such as physical, engineering and biological science in spite of management, social science and humanities. For seeking the financial aid, it is required to submit the form to apply for the financial aid that will be offered to school/college and scholarship service board is responsible for administering the overall procedure.</p>', 1, 7, 'published', 'how-to-finance-your-travel-while-studying', 1, 1, 1, '2018-10-01 16:28:38', '2018-10-01 16:28:38', NULL),

The international students loved to plan to prolong excursion based on multi-countries. The majority of travelling is done during the weekend when there are not test and assignment to make. The planning of hassle-free travel on the weekend will result in higher gratification level of students.&nbsp; In the UK the semester ends in mid of June and recommence from September, it is like about 12 Weeks. In six months, students can earn money wherein the remaining six months; the students can do something exciting and refreshing such as travelling.&nbsp; The best thing is hanging out with international students as it is helpful for learning about the globe, ensure the vicariously travelling across the specific parts of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are some cheap flights available in the UK that makes the life highly exciting if overseas students flash their student&rsquo;s cards.

Even though these airline carriers are not cost-effective, however for the group of students, it doesn&rsquo;t matter in a lot and can be a fun loving experience for the students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is recommended to stay in hostels that are pretty much cost effective and conduct web research on the city prior to travel to the town. The primary city research involves the remarkable use of maps, guidance for language, and advice for health. I firmly believe that the more knowledge you have about the culture and historical background of the place, this instance resulted in more appreciation about the trip. Most important advice is to bring the copy of the passport and visa for the purpose of safety and security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The usage of Expedia can also improve the gratification of travel. It provides the perspective alternatives relied on city distance, cost and accessibility of hotel and hostels.

Few students don&rsquo;t carry some money and mostly relying on debit or credit cards specifically when living in the UK.

Prior to leaving the UK, it is better to have at least about $100 in cash to mitigate any sort of emergency or occasion where money is required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Utilise each perspective and discount opportunity. Tons of discounts are available, and few experiences such as museum and experiences are offering a reduced rate for students. If the option of the student is not presented to you, the student can inquire about the availability of an opportunity. The places are intended for the accommodation of students. The hostels must have tons of ticket discounts for the mainstream of travel experience and result in the win-win situation. During travel abroad, a student can utilise the option of Public Transportation. It recognised as the smaller manner of saving money, specifically Ubers and taxis are considered as the expensive option and don&rsquo;t consider as worthwhile. The Business and Metro are regarded as the secure manner for engagement with people and another member of society in the short run and ensure the living as the local citizen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The students can also consult with any Travel Agency to gain information about any discounted fares. It is indispensable to obtain an International Student Identity Card. The students will be surprised to see the abundant opportunities of student card and some are also sighting for the group based on discounted offers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The overseas students can enjoy the fun-loving and free things across entire Europe. It is advised to inquire about the private information about tourist specifically by considering an event calendar as major EU cities are offering summer festive, exhibits, concerts and more. The majority of cities are offering free events for the general public in the same instant along with steeping discounts for interested students.
